Rising Times Websites


At this point, the only site I need fixed is www.risingtimesbooks.com.

1.   Add "Let's Burn One" to the site under "Other Works."  Hmmmm, I'm not a marketer but I think there should be a change to that title.  Maybe "Barbie's Books" which would mean only It's Not About Love and the Gunner book (the children's book below.)  Then another tab for other people's books but I don't know what to call that either?  Just thought about this while writing you.  "Let's Burn One" is print and eBook on Amazon.com.  Maybe "And All The Rest" unless you have something better.

https://www.amazon.com/Lets-Burn-One-Tempe-1973-ebook/dp/B07SBDC5MP/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?keywords=let%27s+burn+one+joseph+lobiondo&qid=1573406648&sr=8-1-fkmr0

So I guess this turned into 2 things.  Separate out my books (and there are more coming) under "Barbie's Books" and add another tab for whatever you think we should call it, maybe still "Other Works" but that doesn't grab my attention.

2.   As above, the tabs for the books.

3.   Add "Gunner's Vicarious Adventures on the Arizona Trail" to Barbie's Books. 

https://www.amazon.com/Gunners-Vicarious-Adventures-Arizona-Trail/dp/0996654488/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1B5P88QM52JER&keywords=gunner%27s+vicarious+adventures+on+the+arizona+trail&qid=1573406807&sprefix=gunner%27s+vicarious%2Caps%2C194&sr=8-1

4.   Add a banner or blog space to www.risingtimesbooks.com so that I can write there from time to time. 

5.   The contact me place on all three sites should go to emebernames@aol.com.  My test did not go through so who knows what happened.  On the Wildfire site, the orders come to GolightlyInfo@aol.com so I know that works.  (Golightly is my little publishing company.  Rising Times Books is a division of it.)

6.   Next time GoDaddy sends me a notice of malware for the Wildfire site I will pass that along for your review.  Happens from time to time.

7.   If you ever need info on the hosting or registrar for the sites, I do have that.  Anything else Daniel will have.

8.   Let me know what products you would like me to send to you and where to send them.  It will happen!  As to the music, the first of my CDs were done with a young engineer who did digital music.  The "I Love The Cowboys" was done with Jerry Matheny in the studio, as I mentioned on the phone.  We are about 3/4 of the way through the next CD.  He makes my songs turn into magic.

I realize that most people stream music, so down the line if you are knowledgeable in all of that, we may go to streaming as well.  I have no idea how to put things on Spotify or CD baby.  My adopted son has his music there.  www.pennjohnson.net.   Well, he calls me his adopted grandmother but I'm not giving in to grandmother status!
